# FairVote RCV Cruncher

The cruncher is a python-based tool. You can use it to process cast vote records from RCV/IRV/STV jurisdictions and calculate various nifty statistics for each contest.

This is a command line tool and does not have a user interface. If you are unfamiliar with the command line, hopefully the instructions below will help you get started.
