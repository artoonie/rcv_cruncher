The files that appear in this folder contain the ballot information read in from the input CVR files converted into a csv format.

These files will always minimally include ranking columns (formatted as rank1, rank2, etc). Otherwise, any other per-ballot information read in by the parser will also be written out in additional columns (such as ballotID or precinct information).
