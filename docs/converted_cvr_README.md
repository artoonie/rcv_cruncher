The files that appear in this folder contain the ballot information read in from the input CVR files converted into a csv format.

These files will always minimally include ranking columns (formatted as rank1, rank2, etc). Otherwise, any other per-ballot information read in by the parser will also be written out in additional columns (such as ballotID or precinct information). The possible values that can appear in the ranking columns are: candidate name, "overvote", "skipped".
