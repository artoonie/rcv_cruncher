When the 'rank_usage' option is marked as TRUE in the output_config.csv file, the files described below are written out to the `contest_sets/[your_contest_set_dir]/results/rank_usage` directory.

These tables includes rank usage stats, both overall and broken down by first choice candidate.

The first column is just the number ballots on which each choice was ranked first. These counts do not include ballots that had an overvote in the first non-skipped rank. The current reasoning on excluding these overvote ballots is that even though those ballots may end up counting towards a candidate in the first round, in terms of getting a sense of how different groups of supporters used their rankings, including those ballots in these calculations will not reflect actual first choice preferences of voters.  

The first column is followed by two columns indicating the mean and median number of valid rankings used. Valid rankings exclude overvotes and skipped ranks.

Note: this table does not include ballot weights in calculations and counts.
