When the 'crossover_support' option is marked as TRUE in the output_config.csv file, the files described below are written out to the `contest_sets/[your_contest_set_dir]/results/crossover_support` directory.

These tables describe, in one way, the amount of crossover support candidates receive from their opponents' supporters. This is measured by looking at groups of voters that supported each candidate in the first round and seeing which other candidates they included in their top three rankings. In terms of the table, each row describes how voters who marked one candidate as first ranked that candidate's opponents in the next two non-skipped rankings on their ballot. The first column describes the number of ballots the candidate received in the first round. These counts do not include ballots that had an overvote in the first non-skipped rank. The current reasoning on excluding these overvote ballots is that even though those ballots may end up counting towards a candidate in the first round, in terms of getting a sense of how different groups of supporters used their rankings, including those ballots in these calculations will not reflect actual first choice preferences of voters. The following columns describe the count/percent of those first-column ballots that included each other candidate in either the second or third ranking.

Note:

Skipped rankings are skipped over when performing these calculations.
