,,,,"The winner of the election, or, in multiple winner contests, the hypothetical winner if the contest was single winner.",,"The number of non-candidates on the ballot, not including write-ins.",The number of rounds it takes for one candidate (the winner) to receive the majority of the non-exhausted votes. This number includes the round in which the winner receives the majority of the non-exhausted votes. This is based on a tabulator that doesn't eliminate more than one declared candidate per round.,The number of votes for the winner in the final round. The final round is the first round where the winner receives a majority of the non-exhausted votes.,The percent of votes for the winner in the final round.

The condorcet winner is the candidate that would win a 1-on-1 election versus any other candidate in the election.

Note that this is not the same as ""exhausted by undervote"". This is because some juristidictions (Maine) discard any ballot begining with two undervotes regardless of the rest of the content of the ballot, and call this ballot as exhausted by undervote.","The number of ballots with an overvote before any valid ranking. Note that this is not the same as ""exhausted by overvote"". This is because some juristidictions (Maine) discard any ballot begining with two undervotes, and call this ballot as exhausted by undervote, even if the undervotes are followed by an overvote. Other jursidictions (Minneapolis) simply skip over overvotes in a ballot.","The number of ballots that were discarded after the first round due to an overvote. Note that Minneapolis doesn't discard overvote ballots, it simply skips over the overvote.",The number of ballots that were discarded after the first round because not all rankings were used and it was not discarded because of an overvote. This factor will exclude all ballots with overvotes aside from those in Maine where more than one sequential undervote preceeds an overvote.,"The number of ballots that validly used every ranking, but didn't rank any candidate that appeared in the final round.","The number of ballots that rank the same candidate more than once, or include more than one write in candidate.",The number of ballots that have an undervote followed by an overvote or a valid ranking,winner's votes less runner-up's votes (after running an rcv to two candidates and possibly past the round in which the winner receives 50% of the remaining vote)
