Note that this is not the same as ""exhausted by overvote"". This is because some juristidictions (Maine) discard any ballot begining with two undervotes, and call this ballot as exhausted by undervote, even if the undervotes are followed by an overvote.

Note that Minneapolis doesn't discard overvote ballots, it simply skips over the overvote.",The number of ballots that were discarded after the first round because not all rankings were used and it was not discarded because of an overvote.
